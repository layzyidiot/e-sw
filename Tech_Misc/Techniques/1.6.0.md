# Challenges

* 1. Create an empty gameobject.
 
* 2. Rename it to 'ChallengeInfo'.
 
* 3. Add a 'Challenge Info' component to it.

* 4. Add a description for the challenge. Make sure that the text is simple, short and informative. For example: 'Don't fight the Minotaur'.

* 5. Create a new gameobject as a child of the previous one and assign 'SetChallengeStatus' component to it. Then enable 'Active' and disable the gameobject. (Note: if you want the challenge to fail if any condition is met, set it to false).

* 6. Assign the challenge gameobject to the object activator that is activated when your challenge condition is met.

# Tip of the day

* 1. Create an empty gameobject.
 
* 2. Rename it to 'Tip Of The Day'
 
* 3. Add a 'TipOfTheDay' component to it.
 
* 4. Add the tip to it. Note: tips use TMP to color the text.
