Open the "Enemies" tab and increase it size for your enemy.It will copy the . asset from above.

4. Click on a .asset that was just created, choose it and copy its .asset

5. Change its settings and then put it in the "BestiaryDatabase" in the "Enemies" tab.

Now you have a terminal entry for your enemy.
