To start off, you'll first need 2 enemies with the `Machine` component. <i>This will not work if both enemies do not have the </i>`Machine`<i> component. </i>

# Linking the enemies


First, go to enemy 1's `Machine` component, find the `Symbiote` variable, and assign enemy 2's `Machine` component to that. Repeat the same but for enemy 2.

Example for Enemy 2:

For the enemies to heal, you require an animation in the enemy animation controller, named "Knockdown". You do not require any special events<span style="color:Grey;">*</span>, make sure it's at least 2 seconds in length. 







Activate them like you would normally, using `Activate Arena` and `Activate Next Wave`.
