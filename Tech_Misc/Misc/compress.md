# How to compress levels to share on discord or for EnvyDL

<i><span style="color:FireBrick; font-size:20px;">Need help? Come to the Envy & Spite Discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/RY8J67neJ9">https://discord.gg/RY8J67neJ9</a>!</span></i>

# Beginning

Discord has a small file size limit (25 MB), GitHub has a file size limit too (100 MB) and file sharing services such as Qiwi or MediaFire are either temporary or blocked in some countries.

EnvyDL is currently down and you can't upload your levels right now. However some of the steps can be used to upload your levels directly to discord regardless of file size limits (in a similar way to Rude).

>[!WARNING]
>If you can upload your whole .doomah to github without the file size limit stopping you, do that instead.

# How to do it

* 1: Find a file [joining service](https://pinetools.com/join-files).

* 2: Download a [Spite Splitter by Nebula](https://github.com/SatisfiedBucket/SpiteSplitter/releases/tag/V1.0)

* 3: Select the .doomah. It will create parts in the same directory.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>Link the joining service you use whenever you post the splitted files so that people can actually join them together.

# How to upload your level to EnvyDL

>[!NOTE]
>Remember, EnvyDL is not up yet so you will only need to follow previous, this is just for future. If you do not want to upload to EnvyDL then that's it.

* 1: Create a Github Repo for your level (create a github account if you didn't) and make sure it's the same as your level name.

>[!TIP]
>It is recommended that you make a new repo for each of your levels due to how GitHub size limits work.

* 2: If your level is not split (not over github's size limit) then you can upload the .doomah onto the github as is and then link the repo. If it is split then create a new file and name it 'Partitioned' this should create a folder, then type 'blank.txt' and commit changes. Then go to the folder and upload your partitioned files. Once you have uploaded the 'Partitioned' files, delete 'blank.txt' and you are done!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure that the Github Repo is public or we won't be able to upload your level.
