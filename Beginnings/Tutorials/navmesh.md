# Beginning

What is navmesh? A navmesh, short for navigation mesh, its commonly used in video games as a better path finding way instead of drawing a line going to the player or point A to point B performance wise, You could say its a representation of walkable Areas,  navmeshes divides the game's world into a mesh of interconnected quads and faces where the AI can understand where it goes to.

Select every place you plan your enemies to walk on, and mark them as "Static" in the Inspector. And dont forget the important step of marking whether the gameobject is a floor or a wall + setting what layer it is, such as enviroment for indoor gameobjects, and outdoors for outdoors gameobjects.

In conclusion, Navmesh is an important thing in a scene as it allows a enemy to know where it needs/wants to walk from place A to place B and without it, enemies become stupider than jupiter.
