# Beginning

You've finished making your level, how do you test it ingame?

First, click on the `SPITE` tab on the toolbar and hit `Compile Level`. Then, this window will pop up.

<div style="text-align: center;">

* In the `Level Image` you must place a 4:3 ratio image so that it fits perfectly in the frame (**Note: You can only use .pngs as the level image**).

* In the `Author` you can input your username.

* In the `Level Name` you can input your level's name. Do note that this name also appears on the level end screen too.

If you are compiling for the first time, you will have to wait for it to cache the whole project. Every build after shouldn't take as long.
